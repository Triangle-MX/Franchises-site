                <div class="divider-title"></div><br>

            <div class="row" style="text-align: justify;">
               <div class="col-md-6">
                   BusinessKids is an offspring of Comercio Internacional Mexicano S.A. de C.V., a
Company specialized in executive training. After several years of working with
entrepreneurs, we realized that most of the students enrolled in the entrepreneurship
programs and seminars had something in common: fear of undertaking their projects.
We analyzed that a 90% of adults not coming from entrepreneur families does not
consider starting a company, or has fear of possible obstacles or outcomes. In some
cases, these adults decide to try and carry out their projects, but they abandon them as
soon as they face difficulties, perhaps when they see their money running down the
drain or when the market is not answering as they expected. On the other hand, when
a child grows up in an entrepreneurial environment –families where the father, mother,
both or other family member are entrepreneurs- , he learns that risk, challenge and ups
and downs are part of any business, so he will not be afraid when he starts a business
as an adult, and he usually follows through a long-term project. <br><br>
BusinessKids was born to teach children the necessary tools to become entrepreneurs,
such as self-confidence, self-esteem, leadership skills and sales, creativity, financial
education and customer service, among many others. Teaching children to undertake
their own projects is to plant a seed in them that will eventually bloom into a committed
sense of challenge, social conscience and fruitful entrepreneurship.

                <div class="col-md-6">

                    The idea of being an entrepreneur with a sound set of values is one of the first steps
                to change the world for the better.<br><br>
                Most businesses do not survive the first two years; entrepreneurs abandon their
                dream even earlier just to return to a comfort zone, namely being someone else’s
                employee. The lack of entrepreneurial training leads them to disappointment when
                they realize their expectations are not met in the short term.
                It is possible to learn to be a successful entrepreneur, and to understand the
                mechanisms that lead to effectively undertaking any project and seeing it through,
                drawing on innate creativity in order to overcome obstacles that will surely arise in
                the business consolidation process. <br><br>
                Entrepreneurial education makes a difference. <br><br>
                Childhood is the most creative stage of human beings: all our great dreams and ideas
                emerge when we are little. If we encourage kids to make their dreams come true,
                giving them the adequate tools to do so, we will have confident individuals who will
                have the necessary knowledge and social conscience to be the new kind of
                entrepreneurs this world needs. <br><br>
                BusinessKids educates those future leaders and entrepreneurs that will be the driving
                force of change!
